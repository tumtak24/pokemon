These <strong class="selflink">Rare Pokemon</strong> can be quite tricky to catch, especially considering how Pokemon Go works. </p>   <h2 id="The_5_Missing_Pokemon" class="gh-sectionHeader">The 5 Missing Pokemon<br/></h2> <p>As players have progressed in the eternal quest to "Catch 'Em All", it has been noticed that there are a few pokemon who cannot be found yet - perhaps for several reasons. </p> <h3 id="Articuno.2C_Zapdos.2C_and_Moltres" class="gh-sectionHeader">Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres<br/></h3> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>The three legendary birds known as <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Articuno">Articuno</a>, <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Zapdos">Zapdos</a>, and <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Moltres">Moltres</a> have not been found by anyone yet - and it is possible that players have either not reached a high enough level, or the developer Niantic is waiting for a public event to make these birds obtainable. It's worth noting that each of the three gyms have one of the birds as their mascot, which may hint at a possible path towards finding one of the legendary birds. </p> <h3 id="Mewtwo" class="gh-sectionHeader">Mewtwo<br/></h3> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Although seen briefly in the Pokemon Go cinematic trailer, no one has yet seen nor caught the legendary psychic pokemon known as <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Mewtwo" title="Mewtwo">Mewtwo</a>. If you interpret the trailer literally, it appears that Mewtwo may one day become obtainable in a public even in which trainers must group up to battle him so that he can be captured - but the specifics remain to be seen. </p> <h3 id="Ditto" class="gh-sectionHeader">Ditto<br/></h3> <p style="text-align: center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span></p> <p>The curious shape-changing pokemon <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Ditto">Ditto</a> is noticeably absent in the wild - although the Pokdex does list his spot - #132, and those registering a pokemon close to his number can spot his shadow among the others. There seems to be no indication of where he could be hiding, perhaps disguised among the pokemon trainers catch everyday. </p> <h2 id="Region-Specific_Pokeon" class="gh-sectionHeader">Region-Specific Pokeon<br/></h2> <p>Although not 100% confirmed, it appears that certain pokemon may in fact make their homes uniquely to certain continents, and can only be found in the wild in certain parts of the world (excluding those hatched by eggs). These pokemon have so far been documented in specific areas, but more information is needed to confirm that these Pokemon can only be found in the wild in the following places: </p> <ul><li><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Tauros">Tauros</a>: North America</li> <li><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Mr._Mime">Mr. Mime</a>: Western Europe</li> <li><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Kangaskhan">Kangaskhan</a>: Australia / New Zealand</li> <li><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Farfetch%27d">Farfetch'd</a>: Asia</li></ul> <h2 id="How_to_Catch_Rare_Pokemon" class="gh-sectionHeader">How to Catch Rare Pokemon<br/></h2> <p>Before you can catch a rare Pokemon, you must first understand what a rare Pokemon is. For the most part - a rare Pokemon in Pokemon Go is simply a Pokemon not readily found in your area. </p><p>Players may notice that when walking around certain areas - like at home, school, or work - you'll find high concentrations of specific Pokemon. These Pokemon differ depending on where you go. For example, the busy street a few blocks down may yield untold amounts of Zubats, but a friend's house and surrounding area might be a great spot to find Drowzees. </p><p>Pokemon Go often cycles several types of Pokemon in one area, with less common Pokemon that may show up every so often. This is why even in an area plagued with Zubats you can still sometimes find an Eevee wandering through. You can also help influence uncommon Pokemon with the use of <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Incense" title="Incense">Incense</a> or <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lure_Modules" title="Lure Modules">Lure Modules</a>, that pull Pokemon independently from what is being tracked nearby. It is important to note that lures and incense don't always guarantee what appears won't be common, but it can be a better alternative when you are unable to move around. </p><p>Arguably, the best ways to find rare Pokemon are to explore your surroundings. Visit places you haven't before, and see what Pokemon frequent the area. Lure Modules are also great to visit because they guarantee a Pokemon will appear - increasing the chance it may not be a common one. </p> <div class="gh-blue-box">According to a  familiar with Niantic's previous app Ingress, places where Pokemon appear often align with where high cellular usage is in the Ingress app, and using both apps can help you pinpoint where a distant pokemon might be found when tracking.<br/></div> <p>Another surefire method is to <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Eggs_and_Hatching" title="Eggs and Hatching">hatch</a> <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokemon_Eggs">Pokemon Eggs</a> that require greater distances traveled. The types of Pokemon you get from hatching 5 and 10 kilometer eggs will be much more rarer than the 2 kilometer eggs, and can sometimes be Pokemon you can't readily find in your immediate area. </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716001941 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.044 seconds Real time usage: 0.056 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 25/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 32/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:135-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20160716001941 and revision id 993  -->
