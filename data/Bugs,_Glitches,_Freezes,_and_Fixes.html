Take a look at some of the best fixes from the problems you've been having. </p><p>This list is always growing, so keep checking back for new fixes and helpful hints. </p>   <h2 class="proxyh1 gh-sectionHeader" id="Known_Solutions">Known Solutions</h2> <p>Below are some potential solutions for your Pokemon woes. We're constantly updating, <b>and you can also add your own solutions by clicking on the top-right corner.</b> </p> <h2 id="Battery_Drain_Solution_.28Android.2FiOS.29" class="gh-sectionHeader">Battery Drain Solution (Android/iOS)</h2> <p>Pokemon Go eats battery like no one's business. But you can alleviate a lot of the hurt by downloading Google Maps of your local area. Since Go doesn't have to constantly stay in contact with the mapping servers, you save power and make your experience a little more stable. </p>  <p>To do this, download Google Maps from your App store. In the App settings, find Offline Maps and add whatever area you're currently in. </p><p>It's worth noting that Google engineers have said this , but many users maintain reduced battery consumption after saving these maps. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>While playing in low-battery mode is also a potential solution, <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Low_Battery_Glitch">this sometimes seems to cause lock-up issues.</a> </p> <h2 id="Lock-Up_Solutions_.28iPhone.29" class="gh-sectionHeader">Lock-Up Solutions (iPhone)</h2> <p>Pokemon Go freezes a lot. But if you're playing on iPhone, <b>turning off LTE appears to help a lot.</b> To disable LTE on an iPhone 6, navigate to <b>Settings&gt;Cellular&gt;Cellular Data</b> and turn LTE off. </p>  <p>Many common lock-ups appear to be significantly reduced by disabling this communications feature. </p> <h2 id="Location_Hopping_Solution_.28Android.29" class="gh-sectionHeader">Location Hopping Solution (Android)</h2> <p>Is your Pokemon trainer popping all over the map like he or she is teleporting? You may need to activate your full GPS. If you're using an Android phone, true GPS may be disabled by default. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>By manually activating your GPS in Settings, you'll gain much more precise location-finding, (though you'll likely experience decreased battery life as true GPS can resource-intensive). Android phones vary,, but the setting is likely in your Privacy or Location settings, and may be called GPS or High Accuracy Location. </p> <h2 id="Missing_Item_Solutions_.28Android.2FiOS.29" class="gh-sectionHeader">Missing Item Solutions (Android/iOS)</h2> <p>Sometimes items you've found and purchased seem to fail to register in your inventory. Often, doing a complete logout from Pokemon go, followed by a login will correct this error. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Sometimes, Pokemon Go may inform you that items aren't available for purchase in your country/territory. If this happens, be sure to check your purchasing settings or Google Wallet and make sure all your info is up to date. </p> <h2 id="iPhone_4s_unable_to_log_in_.2F_start_app_.28iOS.29" class="gh-sectionHeader">iPhone 4s unable to log in / start app (iOS)</h2> <p>Although Pokemon Go only officially supports the iPhone 5 or newer, older iPhones can still download and attempt to run the app. If you are having troubles with the loading screen giving you an error message that you can't log in, try this: Double tap the home button and fully close the app. Turn on airplane mode by swiping up on the home screen then start the app again. When you see a red bar at the top telling you that there's no internet connection, press the home button and turn airplane mode off. Starting the app once more will allow you to play the game normally. </p><p>Unfortunately if the game crashes or hangs for any reason, you'll need to perform these steps all over again. </p><p><span style="color: rgb(61, 61, 61); font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Keep an Eye Out For Updates (Android/iOS)</span> </p><p>Pokemon Go is rolling out frequent new updates, so keeping your software up to date is one of the best ways to improve and stabilize your favorite new app. </p> <h2 id="Final_Act_of_Desperation_.28Android.2FiOS.29" class="gh-sectionHeader">Final Act of Desperation (Android/iOS)</h2> <p>If all else fails, follow the IT Crowd mantra: turn the app off completely and then turn it back on. This fixes the majority of freezes. Other times, a full power-off, power-on of your device may be necessary. </p> <h2 class="proxyh1 gh-sectionHeader" id="Unresolved_Issues">Unresolved Issues</h2> <p>We don't have fixes yet for a lot of Pokemon's biggest bugs and glitches. But if you've found solutions, we need your help. </p> <div class="gh-blue-box" style="text-align: center;"><b>EDIT this page by clicking on the button on the top-left corner of this page and add your discoveries now!</b></div> <h2 id="Low_Battery_Mode_Bug" class="gh-sectionHeader">Low Battery Mode Bug</h2> <p>Pokemon Go is notoriously rough on your battery. While this isn't a bug in and of itself, it's tangentially connected to other issues and bugs built around trying to preserve power. On some iPhones, activating low battery mode appears to cause some freezes when returning to the Pokemon Go app. </p> <h2 id="Lost_Connections" class="gh-sectionHeader">Lost Connections</h2> <p>Server issues have been a problem for Pokemon Go often resulting in freezes, errors, or crashes. </p> <h2 id="Random_Freezes" class="gh-sectionHeader">Random Freezes</h2> <p>Players have noted freeze ups occuring in a variety of situations, including accessing some Items in capture situations.&#160; </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716002229 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.040 seconds Real time usage: 0.052 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 63/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 92/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:145-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20160716002229 and revision id 994  -->
