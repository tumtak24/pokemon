Once the trainer has reached level 5 and chosen the Gym Team, the player can head to either an unclaimed Gym or Gym of the same color, and help defend the gym by placing a pokemon in the gym. </p><p>Once any amount of pokemon are placed into gyms to defend, check the Shop page and look for a shield icon in the top right. The number inside will list the number of pokemon defending gym, and once every 20 hours, a Defender Bonus will reward the player with PokeCoins and Stardust, increasing the amount for each additional pokemon currently defending a gym. </p> <div class="gh-blue-box">You do not need to have a Pokemon in a gym during the cooldown period - to get the reward, you only need to have at least one pokemon in a Gym when the shield icon is not counting down to the next available chance to claim a reward.<br/></div> <p>If the gyms aren't allowing new pokemon to defend them, the player must train to increase the gym's prestige and increase the Gym Level, to allow more slots for pokemon. </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716215508 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.012 seconds Real time usage: 0.017 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 17/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 34/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:181-0!*!0!!*!*!* and timestamp 20160716215508 and revision id 965  -->
