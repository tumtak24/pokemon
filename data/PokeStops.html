PokeStops are indicated on your map with blue icons, like the ones above.&#160;When you're close enough to interact with the icon, it will change shape. Clicking on the icon will then allows you to swipe the Photo Disc, which will generate items in bubbles. Tap the bubbles to collect your items! (You can also just exit the PokeStop once the items appear and they will be collected regardless). </p><p>After you've collected items from a PokeStop, the icon's color will change to purple, and you will not be able to collect items from it again until it refreshes to blue, which takes about five minutes. Conveniently, you don't need to travel away from the PokeStop for it to refresh, so if you live or work on a PokeStop you can get items often! </p><p>Most often, a PokeStop will grant you three to four items at a time. Until you're level 5, PokeStops will grant you exclusively <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeBalls" title="PokeBalls">PokeBalls</a> and <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Eggs_and_hatching">Pokemon Eggs</a>. One you reach level 5, at times PokeStops will generate up to six PokeBalls, and other <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Items" title="Items">items</a> such as <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Revives" title="Revives">Revives</a> and <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Potions" title="Potions">Potions</a> to use now that your trainer can access <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Team_and_Gyms">Gyms</a> and battle other <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokemon" title="Pokemon" class="mw-redirect">Pokemon</a>. </p> <div class="gh-blue-box">Note that PokeStops can only be interacted with when in range - if you are on a bus or other form of transit, you may not be able to interact in time unless the vehicle is slowing or stopped!<br/></div> <h2 id="Lure_Modules_and_PokeStops" class="gh-sectionHeader">Lure Modules and PokeStops<br/></h2> <p>If a player purchases one of the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lure_Modules" title="Lure Modules">Lure Modules</a> from the in-game <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Shop" title="Shop">Shop</a>, the player can place a lure at any PokeStop to increase the amount of Pokemon who will gravitate to that area - and this will benefit any other players in the area. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>You can even see when a PokeStop is under the influence of a Lure Module on the map by looking for the showering of pink petals, and interacting with the PokeStop will have an icon that details who used the lure. </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716182448 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.056 seconds Real time usage: 0.080 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 4/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 10/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:18-0!*!0!*!*!4!* and timestamp 20160716182448 and revision id 258  -->
