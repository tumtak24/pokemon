                <p>Want tips and tricks for Pokemon Go? Find out the very first things you should do to succeed in the newest catch-em-all adventure! </p>   <h2 id="Check_in_at_PokeStops.21" class="gh-sectionHeader">Check in at PokeStops!<br/></h2> <p>Look around on your map for the blue icons that denote <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokestops" title="Pokestops" class="mw-redirect">Pokestops</a>. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>These blue icons are often landmarks, sculptures, noteworthy buildings and more, and getting close to and <b>swiping the image that appears in the circle</b> will score you free items like <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Poke_Balls" title="Poke Balls">Poke Balls</a> to catch Pokemon, <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Eggs">Eggs</a> to hatch Pokemon, and upon reaching level 5 - <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Potions" title="Potions">Potions</a> and <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Revives" title="Revives">Revives</a> to heal your Pokemon from <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Teams_and_Gyms" title="Teams and Gyms">Gym Battles</a>. </p>  <p>To use the Pokestop, you must move your character near enough to activate it (there's a ring around your character that shows how close you are). Once you have it activated, you must <b>tap on the blue icon, then swipe to spin the blue disc that shows a picture of the spot on your screen</b>. This will release items. You can either tap to collect them, or simply exit the Pokestop and they will be collected anyways. </p>  <p>Note that you must remain near the Pokestop to obtain the items, which can be difficult in moving vehicles! </p> <h2 id="Popular_Places_Equal_More_PokeStops" class="gh-sectionHeader">Popular Places Equal More PokeStops<br/></h2> <p>If you're in a pretty lonely area, consider taking a trip to a local park, mall, or other hotspot where you are likely to find more points of interest that will in turn give you more free items. </p> <h2 id="Turn_on_Battery_Saver" class="gh-sectionHeader">Turn on Battery Saver</h2> <p>This may seem like an obvious one, but Pokemon Go is, at launch, quite the drain on your phone's battery. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Some light searching in the tall grass of your surroundings should be fine on a half-charged phone, but for long expeditions along local routes, be sure to go out with a fully charged phone — and maybe even bring an external charger along in case things go bad while catching a <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokemon" title="Pokemon" class="mw-redirect">Pokemon</a>. </p><p>The <b>app also includes a "Battery Saver" option in its Settings</b> <b>menu</b>, which darkens and minimizes the game when the phone is upside down (preferably in one's pocket) but still tracks and alerts when Pokemon or PokeStops are encountered. </p> <div class="gh-blue-box">With constant server outages at the game's launch, the settings may sometimes be reset - so be sure to check the settings from time to time to makes sure battery saver is still enabled.<br/></div> <h2 id="Personalize_Your_Pokemon" class="gh-sectionHeader">Personalize Your Pokemon</h2> <p>GO retains one of the main Pokemon games' most important options — renaming your Pokemon. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Even after you capture a creature out in the wild, simply open up the "Pokemon" option in your menu, click on a particular one, and give it whichever name you'd like. (And yes, at launch, you can include curses in your Pokemon's name.) </p> <h2 id="Track_Pokemon_.28and_know_your_Pokemon_Shapes.29" class="gh-sectionHeader">Track Pokemon (and know your Pokemon Shapes)<br/></h2>  <p>Pokemon Go will give players an idea of the Pokemon in the nearby area with icons appearing the bottom right-hand corner of the app. They remain shrouded in shadow when you haven't yet caught that type. The mystery keeps things fun — and resembles the unknown of wandering around in the original Pokemon games — but having an idea of which Pokemon are available to you could make all the difference as as you collect and train to be the very best like no one ever was. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Not only will the tracker list nearby Pokemon, <b>but the number of footprints underneath the Pokemon will dicate how far away that Pokemon is </b>(one footprint being close and three being farther away). You can track an individial Pokemon by tapping on it, at which point only that Pokemon will appear in the bottom right corner, and the icon will begin blink if the steps change when you are closer or further away. When the Pokemon has no footprints underneath it, will be summoned in your radius.&#160; </p> <h2 id="Transfer_Your_Doubles" class="gh-sectionHeader">Transfer Your Doubles<br/></h2> <p>When you catch Pokemon, you have the option to transfer them to Professor Willow. Doing so will get you <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokemon_Candy" title="Pokemon Candy">Pokemon Candy for</a> the Pokemon you transfered, which you can then collect to eventually evolve that Pokemon, or power up their Combat Points. <b>Click on the Pokemon button, then click on a Pokemon and scroll all the way down, past the small map that shows you where your Pokemon was caught. </b>Here you can touch the Transfer button and confirm you want to actually get rid of the selected Pokemon.&#160; </p><p>However, before you transfer a double (or triple) to the professor, analyze the Pokemon's stats and compare it to the other Pokemon of the same kind that you already have. Which has a higher CP? What attacks does each have? Which weighs more? Figure out those, then transfer the weaker of the two. </p><p>You are now ready for the best part of Pokemon Go: <b><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Catch_Pokemon" title="How to Catch Pokemon">How to Catch Pokemon</a></b> </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716000644 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.044 seconds Real time usage: 0.058 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 51/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 90/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:26-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20160716000644 and revision id 988  -->
