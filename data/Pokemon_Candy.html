It cannot be purchased in the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Shop" title="Shop">shop</a>, and so must be earned by performing certain actions within the game. </p> <p style="text-align: center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span></p> <p>There are a few methods you can use to earn Candy: </p> <h3 id="Catching_Pokemon" class="gh-sectionHeader"><b>Catching Pokemon</b></h3> <p>Each time you catch a Pokemon, you'll be awarded 100 <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Stardust" title="Stardust">Stardust</a> and three Candy, specific to the Pokemon you just caught. For example, if you just caught a Pidgey, you will earn three Pidgey Candy. If you catch an evolved Pokemon, like a Pidgeot, you will still earn three Pidgey Candy. </p> <h3 id="Hatching_Pokemon" class="gh-sectionHeader"><b>Hatching Pokemon</b><br/></h3> <p><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Eggs_and_hatching">Hatching a Pokemon</a> will award you with even more Candy and Stardust than catching a Pokemon will! It will also give you a pretty fair amount of XP to <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_level_your_trainer">help level your Trainer.</a> </p> <h3 id="Transferring_Pokemon" class="gh-sectionHeader"><b>Transferring Pokemon</b></h3> <p>Transferring a Pokemon will award you with a single Candy of that Pokemon, regardless of its CP or evolution stage.&#160; Make sure to go through your Pokemon before transferring them, as once you transfer a Pokemon to Professor Willow in exchange for a Candy, you can never get it back. </p><p><b>The best way to get the Pokemon Candy you want is to <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_catch_pokemon">track down lots of Pokemon to catch!</a></b> </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716053854 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.040 seconds Real time usage: 0.053 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 12/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 18/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:108-0!*!0!!*!4!* and timestamp 20160716053854 and revision id 364  -->
