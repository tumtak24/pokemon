Depending on the specific device being used for play (Android, iPhone, etc) and the network connection (3G, 4G, LTE), data usage may vary. </p>  <p>You can see how much data the app has used so far (and measure how much it takes up for you) by taking the following action: </p> <h3 id="On_Android" class="gh-sectionHeader">On Android</h3> <ol><li>Go to 'Settings'.</li> <li>Open 'Data Usage'.</li> <li>Set your Date Range.</li> <li>Scroll down to locate the Pokemon Go information.</li></ol> <h3 id="On_iPhone" class="gh-sectionHeader">On iPhone</h3> <ol><li>Open Settings menu.</li> <li>Select "Cellular".</li> <li>Scroll down to Pokemon Go information.</li></ol> <h2 id="How_to_Reduce_Data_Usage_for_Pokemon_Go" class="gh-sectionHeader">How to Reduce Data Usage for Pokemon Go</h2> <p>There are a few ways to avoid using an excess amount of cellular data when playing Pokemon Go. </p> <h3 id="Play_on_Wifi" class="gh-sectionHeader">Play on Wifi</h3> <p>This may seem obvious, but you'd be surprised how often people forget to connect to an available WiFi network. </p>  <p>Make sure to connect to a WiFi network whenever possible while hunting Pokemon. Of course, use proper judgement when connecting to public networks and hotspots. </p> <h3 id="Download_Local_Maps" class="gh-sectionHeader">Download Local Maps</h3> <p>Some users have reported that downloading their local area maps from the Google Maps app has significantly reduced their data consumption (since Go pulls from Google Maps for it's location data). </p><p>To download your area maps, complete the following steps: </p> <ol><li>Open Google Maps app on the device you use for Pokemon Go.</li> <li>Open the Settings menu.</li> <li>Select 'Offline Areas'.</li> <li>Press the '+' button.</li> <li>Size the on-screen map around the area you want to download.</li> <li>Select 'Download'.</li></ol> <p>It's worth noting that Google engineers have said this , but many users maintain reduced data consumption after saving these maps. </p> <h3 id="Close_Background_Apps" class="gh-sectionHeader">Close Background Apps</h3> <p>When running Pokemon Go, avoid doubling up on data usage by closing any network-enabled apps that may be running in the background. </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716002155 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.016 seconds Real time usage: 0.021 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 45/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 72/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:141-0!*!*!!en!*!* and timestamp 20160716002155 and revision id 478  -->
