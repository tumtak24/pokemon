Your first step is to investigate the world around you, especially rusting wild grasses you'll see on your Pokemon Go world map. Rustling wild grass does not always indicate a Pokemon. By clicking on the lower-right bar, you'll see a list of different nearby Pokemon profiles.  </p><p>Their distance from you is indicated by a set of footprints. Three-footprint Pokemon are quite far away, while zero-footprint Pokemon are right on top of you-they may take a few seconds to spawn. Your phone may vibrate when nearby<b>.</b> </p> <b></b> <div class="gh-blue-box"><b>Tip: Tracking Pokemon&#160;</b>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; You can successfully track specific Pokemon if you keep your eye on the Nearby Pokemon list, as seen in the video above. If the Pokemon icon is moving up the list to the top left spot, that means you're getting closer to it! Try going in different directions until it gets less foot prints and moves up the list. You may find yourself right next to that elusive Scyther soon!&#160;<br/><br/>Also keep in mind that Pokemon will generally spawn in the same exact spot for everyone! So if you see a crowd of Trainers intensely staring at their Pokemon GO device, odds are they're catching a rare Pokemon.&#160;<br/></div> <p>The <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Incense" title="Incense">Incense</a> <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Item">Item</a> helps draw Pokemon closer to you. Placing a <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lure_Module" title="Lure Module">Lure Module</a> at a <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeStop">PokeStop</a> will work even better, plus every Trainer in the vicinity of the PokeStop will also receive the benefits for 30 minutes. Using Incense surrounds your Trainer with pink-purple smoke. PokeStops affected by a Lure Module will be surounded by what appears to be cherry blossom petals. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p><br/> </p><p>Once you've tracked down a Pokemon, you'll see it on the map within your vicinity. Tap on it to initiate the capture sequence! Catching these pocket monsters is very different than capturing in traditional Pokemon games. </p><p>You won't be setting your Pokemon against one another in any turn-based RPG battles. Instead, you need get close, then hurl your Pokeball with perfect timing to maximize your chances of a successful capture. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p><i>Tip: Though rotating your camera can cause you to lose your onscreen view of a Pokemon, sidestepping while holding the phone steady allows you to safely re-frame the Pokemon for a nice Snapshot.</i> </p><p>If AR is enabled, keep the Pokemon centered on your screen, holding your phone as still as possible. Use a gentle fingertip swipe in a straight line toward your target. You want to time your toss so that the ring around the Pokemon is contracted to its smallest when you connect. Green is best, yellow more difficult, and red a very difficult capture. ] </p><p>To make the capture process easier, you can switch off AR/camera mode in Pokemon Go. You can continue to walk and try to capture the Pokemon, but if you lose connection to the server in low-signal areas, you may lose the Pokemon. ] </p><p>Pokemon Combat Power (CP) and your Trainer Level effect the chances of a capture. </p><p>You can use the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Razz_Berries" title="Razz Berries">Razz Berries</a> Item mid-battle to help increase the odds of a successful capture, as will&#160;<a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Great_Ball" title="Great Ball">Great Balls</a>, <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Ultra_Balls" title="Ultra Balls">Ultra Balls</a>, and <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Master_Balls" title="Master Balls">Master Balls</a>. ] </p><p>By spinning the Pokeball in a circular motion, your Poke Ball will begin to sparkle.
