Whether you're training at a friendly Gym or challenging an opposing team, you'll need to know the basics. </p><p><br/> </p>   <h2 id="Battle_Basics" class="gh-sectionHeader">Battle Basics</h2> <p>Unlike the thought-provoking, nerve-rattling turn-based battles featured in the original Pokemon games, Pokemon GO's battles are short, quick, and simple. </p><p>Battles are in real time which demands you to act quickly. Simply tap the screen to attack with your Pokemon's basic attack and swipe left or right to dodge before your opponent's attack hits. Dodging is definitely easier said than done. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Once you've filled up some of the blue meter below your Pokemon's health bar by attacking normally, you can unleash a more powerful attack by holding down on the screen before releasing.&#160; </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>The move listed first in a Pokemon's profile is the basic attack, and the second move is the powerful attack. Moves can have different meters, indicating how many powerful attacks can be stored at a time. </p> <h2 id="Choosing_Your_Pokemon" class="gh-sectionHeader">Choosing Your Pokemon</h2> <p>The usual rock-paper-scissor Pokemon rules are followed during battles in Pokemon GO. When challenging an enemy Gym, you can bring six Pokemon with you. If you are training at a friendly Gym, you'll only be allowed one Pokemon - so pick the one who can endure the most. Look at what types of Pokemon you'll be facing and plan accordingly. If your opponents will be using mostly Grass-type Pokemon, try to bring Pokemon that are resistant to Grass-type moves, like Steel-type Pokemon, or have moves that are super effective against Grass-types, like Fire- or Flying-type. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Though strategic type choices will give you an edge, the most important stat to look for when choosing your Pokemon is their CP, or Combat Power. A Pokemon's CP is essentially a rating of how strong that Pokemon is. The higher a CP, the stronger that Pokemon. Even if you have the best type advantage imaginable, if your Pidgey's CP is 15 and the Pinser's CP is 110, you don't stand a chance. </p><p>Ideally, you'll be able to choose a team of Pokemon that have a CP rating close to the Gym's Pokemon and some sort of type advantage! Check out <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Train_Your_Pokemon" title="How to Train Your Pokemon" class="mw-redirect">How to Train Your Pokemon</a> to learn how to increase your Pokemon's CP. </p> <h3 id="Enemy_Gyms_vs_Friendly_Gyms" class="gh-sectionHeader">Enemy Gyms vs Friendly Gyms<br/></h3> <p>Depending on which team you side with, the Gym you encounter may be friendly or rivals to you. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>If you interact with a friendly Gym, you can train by facing the team with a Pokemon of your own. The more defenders your single Pokemon defeats, the more experience you'll earn, as well as increasing the Gym's Prestige points, increasing the Gym's overall level and allowing more trainers to defend it. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>When interacting with a rival gym, you can only fight them - choosing up to six of your Pokemon. Note that if you see explosions and signs of battle in the tower on the map - that means another trainer is fighting - and you can join in too, and fight alongside them to take down tough Pokemon! </p> <h2 id="The_Aftermath" class="gh-sectionHeader">The Aftermath</h2> <p>After a battle, your Pokemon may be left with low HP, or worse, have fainted! They unfortunately will not heal on their own and will need your intervention. Note that Pokemon can only faint in rival Gym Battles - and training with the friendly Gym will only lower your Pokemon's health to 1. </p><p>If you've been visiting <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeStops" title="PokeStops">PokeStops</a>, you should have plenty of Potions and Revives. Simply go into the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Items" title="Items">Items</a> page, click the Revive, and then click the Pokemon you'd like to use it on. Then use Potions on every Pokemon you'd like to recover. Some Pokemon may need more than one to return to 100 percent health! </p><p>If you are fighting a rival Gym, defeating the team's pokemon will slowly lower their prestige rating until defenders are forced to drop out as the Gym's level lowers - until only the leader is left. By repeadtedly defeating the leader until the Gym's prestige lowers to nothing - the gym will become neutral and claimable by you. </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160715223720 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.048 seconds Real time usage: 0.079 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 15/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 20/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:69-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20160715223720 and revision id 416  -->
