They will attract a greater number and variety of pokemon to the attached Pokestop. </p> <h2 id="How_to_Use_a_Lure_Module" class="gh-sectionHeader">How to Use a Lure Module</h2> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>When deployed, any PokeStop under the influence can be seen on the map with a shower of pink petals around the stop. This can be seen by all players, as Pokemon attracted to the location can be found by any player at that location - making it a great item to use with friends. A new Pokemon will show up approximately every 3 minutes. </p><p>Lure Modules can be purchased from the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Shop" title="Shop">Shop</a> either one for 100 <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeCoins" title="PokeCoins" class="mw-redirect">PokeCoins</a>, or 8 Modules for 680 PokeCoins. Additionally, when the trainer reaches certain levels - like level 8, they will also receive a free Lure Module.
