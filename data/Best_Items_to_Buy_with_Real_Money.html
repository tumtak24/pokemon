What's the best way to spend your hard earned money in the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Shop" title="Shop">Shop</a>, anyway? </p>  <p>We've already put together a great $10 "starter pack" that includes an array of items that will benefit anyone. Check out the video above.&#160; </p> <div class="gh-blue-box"><b>Tip:&#160;</b>Don't spend PokeCoins on <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Poke_Balls" title="Poke Balls">Poke Balls</a>! Visiting <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeStops" title="PokeStops">PokeStops</a>&#160;often will award you with plenty of Pokemon-catching devices.&#160;<br/></div> <p>First, purchase the $10 pack of <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeCoins" title="PokeCoins" class="mw-redirect">PokeCoins</a> to get a little extra. Our suggested&#160;<b>Starter Pack </b>includes:&#160; </p> <table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" style="width: 425px">  <tr> <td> <b>Item</b> </td> <td> <b>Number</b><br/> </td> <td> <b>Cost (in PokeCoins)</b><br/> </td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Incense" title="Incense">Incense</a> </td> <td> Bundle of 8 </td> <td> 500 </td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lucky_Eggs" title="Lucky Eggs">Lucky Eggs</a> </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 240 </td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lure_Modules" title="Lure Modules">Lure Modules</a> </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 200 </td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Bag_Upgrade" title="Bag Upgrade">Bag Upgrade</a> </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 200 </td></tr></table> <p>With these items, you'll have four hours of extra Pokemon-attracting action, one and a half hours of double XP to really <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Level_Your_Trainer" title="How to Level Your Trainer" class="mw-redirect">make the most of catching and evolving Pokemon</a>, one hour of Pokemon-luring magic when you're stuck in one place, and 50 extra item slots in your bag! You'll also have 60 PokeCoins left over, which won't get you anything. But, <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Teams_and_Gyms" title="Teams and Gyms">defend two gyms</a> and you'll have enough to buy another Lucky Egg or Incense. </p><p>Think your needs are a little more niche?

Free extra Pokemon encounters for all! Who wouldn't be attracted to that?&#160; </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>With the $9.99 1,200 PokeCoin bundle, you can get <b>13 Lure Modules</b> and still have some PokeCoins left over. That's six and a half hours of people and Pokemon luring goodness! Take advantage of the crowds and connect with fellow trainers, preferably at a usually well-populated park during the day. Pick a place with a lot of Pokemon points-of-interest nearby, like Gyms, to maximize the traffic your Lure Module brings in. </p><p><br/> </p> <h3 id="If_you.27re_a_hoarder" class="gh-sectionHeader">If you're a hoarder<br/></h3> <p>So, you're surrounded by PokeStops, and hit them multiple times a day? Can't bear to part with your <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Potions" title="Potions">Potions</a> even though you're approaching Level 20, <i>just in case</i>? </p><p>What? You have <i>how</i> many Rattata? </p><p>It's okay, really. You should always be prepared for trouble, and every Pokemon is special and unique in its own way! You're just going to need a bigger bag to hold everything in. </p><p><b>A Bag Upgrade and <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokemon_Storage_Upgrade" title="Pokemon Storage Upgrade">Pokemon Storage Upgrade</a>&#160;increase your item or Pokemon storage capacity by 50 and cost 200 PokeCoins each.</b> Luckily, each 50 slot upgrade costs the same, so you can really increase the size of your storage with the $9.99 bundle of 1,200 PokeCoins. </p><p>If you care about your little Pokemon friends and want to save them from the soul-crushing fate of being ground up into <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokemon_Candy" title="Pokemon Candy">Pokemon Candy</a>, you could invest entirely in Pokemon Storage Upgrades and increase your capacity from 250 to 550! Save all the Pokemon! </p><p>More interested in the utility of having every item at your fingertips whenever you need it? Invest entirely in Bag Upgrades, and increase your capacity from a measly 350 to a ridiculous 650. </p><p>You may possibly need a stronger build to carry that bag now. How are you not over-encumbered? </p> <h3 id="If_You_Have_Little_Time_To_Play" class="gh-sectionHeader">If You Have Little Time To Play</h3> <p>Time is PokeCoins, and you don't have a lot of it. Between work, school, chores, and that bug infestation that really needs your attention, you can't spend hours a day exploring with Pokemon GO. So what do you do with the time you do have? </p><p>Be as efficient as possible with items! If you can set aside a single hour, you can make a lot of progress. This also applies to those who can't get to a high-activity Pokemon GO areas often. Here's how with $9.99 worth of PokeCoins: </p><p><b>With 1,200 PokeCoins in hand, purchase an eight-pack of Incense and an eight-pack of Lucky Eggs, both 500 PokeCoins. </b>That's four hours of double-XP and extra Pokemon Encounters! </p><p>With the leftover 200 PokeCoins, you can buy another pair of a Lucky Egg and an Incense, a Bag Upgrade if you never have enough space for Items, or an <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Egg_Incubator">Egg Incubator</a> if you always have too many <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Eggs_and_Hatching" title="Eggs and Hatching">Eggs</a> and rarely have time to walk to hatch them. </p><p><b>Tip:</b> If you have more than one Egg Incubator on hand, always use your infinite-use Incubator on the 2km Eggs. This way, you'll get the most use out of it! </p><p>When you do have time to play, try to head to an area with lots of PokeStops around. Each PokeStop gives you items and 50xp, plus there are usually many more Pokemon in these areas. Activate a Lucky Egg and an Incense if you know you'll have at least 30 minutes to maximize your experience and Pokemon encounters! Keep walking to ensure you'll hatch some Eggs, too. </p><p><br/> </p> <h3 id="If_You_Need_to_Be_the_Very_Best" class="gh-sectionHeader">If You Need to Be the Very Best</h3> <p>Trainer Level is everything to you. It makes sense that it should be. It's a sign of your progress, your prestige, your Pokemon-prominence among your friends. It ensures you'll run into rarer, stronger Pokemon, and it allows you to say, <i>"I've been Level 20 since the first week,"</i> with a smug stupid grin accompanied by a haughty hair flip, wafting the scent of your best-ness into your under-leveled rival's dumb nose. </p><p>Here's what you'll need, with 1,200 PokeCoins: </p> <ul><li><b>8-Pack of Lucky Eggs (500 PokeCoins)</b></li> <li><b>8-Pack of Incense (500 PokeCoins)</b></li> <li><b>Egg Incubator (150 PokeCoins)</b></li></ul> <p>Read how to take full advantage of these items on the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Level_your_Trainer">How to Level your Trainer</a> Page. You'll need a lot of fodder Pokemon, like Pidgey or Zubat, to pull off your ploy. </p><p>Then leave a, <i>"Gary was here, everyone else is a loser,"</i> sign on your Gym that no one can take from you. Call it a day. Go home. Bathe in your PokeCoins. </p> <h3 id="if_you_want_to_spend_more_money" class="gh-sectionHeader">if you want to spend more money</h3> <p>If you want to spend more money on Pokemon GO, it's pretty easy. Just scroll down on the Shop page and pick the PokeCoin bundle that's most appealing to you. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Compared to getting only 100 PokeCoins at a time for $0.99 each, bigger bundles give you more for "free." &#160;Getting the $19.99 pack gives you an extra 500; the $39.99 pack gives you an extra 1,200; and the $99.99 pack gives you an extra 4,500. The $99.99 pack essentially saves you about $143, compared to if you were to purchase only 100 PokeCoin packs.&#160; Keep in mind that these items are not necessary to progress in the game. PokeStops give you all the items you absolutely need: <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Poke_Balls" title="Poke Balls">Poke Balls</a>, <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Potions" title="Potions">Potions</a>, and <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Revives" title="Revives">Revives</a>, as well as <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Razz_Berries" title="Razz Berries">Razz Berries</a>. <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Level_Rewards_and_Unlockable_Items" title="Level Rewards and Unlockable Items">Leveling up</a> also awards you with a few of the items sold in the shop! </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160715232150 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.048 seconds Real time usage: 0.062 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 29/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 46/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:192-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20160715232150 and revision id 950  -->
