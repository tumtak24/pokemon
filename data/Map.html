This wiki page collects information on how the overall map in Pokemon Go works, what you can find, and tips for optimizing your experience. </p>   <h2 id="Understanding_the_Map" class="gh-sectionHeader">Understanding the Map<br/></h2>  <p>As the map is created by synching your GPS with Google Maps, you're likely to find a detailed map of the area you find yourself in -- complete with streets, alleys, buildings, parks, and bodies of water. Your trainer will embody you, the player, usually standing wherever you yourself are in the real world, and constantly ping out a pulse that covers a small radius around you. This is the radius that you the player can effect when you are in range of certain things. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>The Pokemon tracker pulsing in the bottom-right corner brings up a display of nearby Pokemon when tapped. The Pokemon in the top-left corner of this display is always the nearest to your current position. The number of pawprints beneath indicates relative distance: zero to one are close, while three are distant. </p><p>There's no real indication of the direction you'll find the Pokemon in, but the bar in the bottom-right corner of the map pulses when they change position relative to you. In terms of distance, three paws can be quite a long way; perhaps several city blocks.&#160; </p><p>Around you, you'll often see various points of interest, detailed below: </p> <h3 id="PokeStops" class="gh-sectionHeader">PokeStops<br/></h3> <p>The PokeStop is noted by a blue icon with a cube hovering over it. These are interactable areas that players can stop at to receive items and experience. When a player is close enough that their pulse touches the PokeStop's ring of influence, the PokeStop will expand to display a Poke Ball Icon. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span>&#160;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>The player can then <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokestops" title="Pokestops" class="mw-redirect">tap on the PokeStop</a> to see the point of interest -- along with a picture to easily identify it -- as many PokeStops are created from art, sculptures, or buildings. If the player is in range, you can swipe to spin the image to gain items and experience. PokeStops will refresh every 5 or so minutes. Note that sometimes a PokeStop will turn blue but not yet shed items for you -- that simply means to be patient and wait just another minute or so. </p> <div class="gh-blue-box">A PokeStop that is showering pink petals is under the influence of a Lure Module that any player can attatch to increase Pokemon drawn to the PokeStop, obtainable by any nearby player.<br/></div> <h3 id="Gyms" class="gh-sectionHeader">Gyms<br/></h3> <p>Gyms are large towers that appear on the horizon in one of four colors (corresponding to neutral or the team colors), usually with a Pokemon standing on top. <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Become_a_Gym_Leader" title="How to Become a Gym Leader">These are where trainers can battle</a> other Pokemon, both fighting at rival gyms or training at friendly ones. The size of the tower often indicates how powerful the gym is, as the amount of prestige will allow more trainers to place their Pokemon in the gym, with the strongest being the Gym Leader. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>A player can fight at a rival gym with a team of six Pokemon to steadily lower the gym's prestige the more enemy Pokemon are defeated, as well as earning experience. As the gym's prestige lowers, the level will decrease, and the lowest level pokemon will be removed until the gym turns grey and neutral, allowing anyone to claim it for their team. </p> <div class="gh-blue-box">Is the Pokemon Gym you see nearby exploding at the top with signs of battle? That means other players are trying to train or fight at the gym. You can even attack the gym with other players, allowing Pokemon to fight alongside you to take down a gym.<br/></div> <h3 id="Tall_Grass" class="gh-sectionHeader">Tall Grass<br/></h3> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Tall grass is noted by the shuffling of grass and leaves seen in random areas on the map. These often indicate the presence of nearby Pokemon in the vicinity, but they do not mean that you will always find a Pokemon when approaching the moving grass. Use it as a general indicator to explore the area, but don't misunderstand it as the actual locations of Pokemon shown in your tracker. </p> <h3 id="Parks" class="gh-sectionHeader">Parks<br/></h3> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>Parks that have been classified in Google Maps will be shown as dark green areas that contrast against the lighter green of other areas in the map. Parks are a great place to look for Pokemon, as there will be much more concentrated areas of tall grass allowing for a greater variety of pokemon. </p> <h3 id="Water" class="gh-sectionHeader">Water<br/></h3> <p>Oceans, lakes, rivers, ponds and other sources of water appear as blue on your map, taken directly from Google Maps. These areas are often great places to skirt the edge of, as players can often find high concentration of water type Pokemon found on the sides of any water source. </p> <h2 id="Map_Tips" class="gh-sectionHeader">Map Tips<br/></h2> <p>Below you will find tips on making the most of your experience using the map to find new pokemon and places to explore. </p> <ul><li>Many users swear that&#160;downloading the Google Maps app improves battery usage. Since the Pokemon Go app is constantly pinging Google Maps, you can (possibly) offset some of this usage by downloading the Google Maps off the App Store, though the validity of this has been questioned (including by a Google engineer). Once downloaded, click on the sidebar in the app itself, and select "Offline Areas" where you can then select an area of the map to download to your phone that can be referenced more easily, saving on battery consumption.</li> <li>Want to know where you can expect to find PokeStops and Gyms? All points were built off Niantic's previous project,&#160;The . By using that&#160;program, you can get a look at which points of interest are likely to become PokeStops and Gyms.</li> <li>Explore to find new areas, PokeStops, Gyms, and more Pokemon variety. Certain areas often have disctinct cycles of Pokemon found more often than in another area, and by moving around, you may find other locations that Pokemon you are looking for congregate.</li> <li>Check Gyms from a distance before engaging. You can save yourself some time by scoping out a gym in advence, as they load quite far in the distance. From there you can figure out if it's worth training or attacking based on the level of the gym and Pokemon inside.</li> <li>If in a moving vehicle (and NOT operating it) it's important to note that you can only interact with PokeStops and Gyms if the player is close enough and remains there long enough. However, if you are good at timing, or slowed down enough, you can interact with a PokeStop out of range and spin the disc right as you pass it by. Pokemon however can be interacted with as you move, and will sit with you in the car until you catch them (or they run away!)</li></ul>  <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716165955 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.048 seconds Real time usage: 0.096 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 38/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 56/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:137-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20160716165955 and revision id 1003  -->
