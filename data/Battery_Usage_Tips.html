However, if you then hold your phone upside down (in your hand or pocket) the screen will darken and display a faint Pokemon Go logo. In this mode you won't be able to see anything, but the game will still track you on GPS, pedometer count for hatching eggs, and vibrate if any pokemon nearby pop up - making it a better alternative to minmizing the game (which doesn't track anything) </p> <h3 id="Turn_off_WiFi_and_Bluetooth" class="gh-sectionHeader">Turn off WiFi and Bluetooth</h3> <p>While out roaming the streets or woods - i.e. <b>not</b> able to connect to reliable WiFi - disable your phones WiFi / Bluetooth functions (unless they're currently in use). </p><p>Constantly searching for and attempting to connect to Bluetooth or WiFi signals will greatly contribute to your battery usage, so eliminate it whenever possible. </p> <h3 id="Download_Local_Maps" class="gh-sectionHeader">Download Local Maps</h3> <p>Some users have reported that downloading their local area maps from the Google Maps app has significantly reduced their battery usage (since Go pulls from Google Maps for it's location data). </p><p>To download your area maps, complete the following steps: </p> <ol><li>Open Google Maps app on the device you use for Pokemon Go.</li> <li>Open the Settings menu.</li> <li>Select 'Offline Areas'.</li> <li>Press the '+' button.</li> <li>Size the on-screen map around the area you want to download.</li> <li>Select 'Download'.</li></ol> <p>It's worth noting that Google engineers have said this , but many users maintain reduced battery consumption after saving these maps. </p> <h3 id="Purchase_an_External_Battery_Pack" class="gh-sectionHeader">Purchase an External Battery Pack</h3> <p>If you absolutely <i>can't</i> live without playing every second of every day, seriously consider investing in a </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716183431 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.016 seconds Real time usage: 0.021 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 40/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 56/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:143-0!*!*!!en!*!* and timestamp 20160716183431 and revision id 503  -->
