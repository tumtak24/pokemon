If you want to become a gym leader, be sure to check out the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Become_a_Gym_Leader" title="How to Become a Gym Leader">How to Become a Gym Leader</a> guide. </p><p>If you've just started Pokemon Go, you won't be able to access Pokemon Gyms or Teams until you've reached . </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <div style="margin:21px;"><div class="gh-polldaddy-container"><script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9469537.js"></script><noscript><a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/9469537/">Vote on the poll!</a></noscript></div></div>   <h2 id="Teams" class="gh-sectionHeader">Teams</h2> <p>After reaching Trainer Level 5, you can finally interact with a Pokemon Gym. Professor Willow will introduce you to his three assistants, who each lead one of three teams you must choose to join: Team Instinct (Yellow), Team Mystic (Blue), and Team Valor (Red). </p><p>The lore for each team is light, but it exists. Each of Professor Willow's assistants have their own research focus. </p> <h3 id="Team_Valor" class="gh-sectionHeader">Team Valor<br/></h3> <div class="center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span></div> <p><b>Team Valor </b>is lead by the <b>Candela</b>, who values training and strength. Candela is researching ways to enhance Pokemon's natural power as she tries to find true strength. </p><p>The Red Team's logo is styled after the legendary bird Moltres. </p> <h3 id="Team_Instinct" class="gh-sectionHeader">Team Instinct<br/></h3> <div class="center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span></div> <p>Team Instinct is led by&#160;Spark, who&#160;believes you will never lose when you trust your instincts. Spark studies Pokemon's intuition, and thinks that it's related to how Pokemon are hatched. </p><p>The Yellow Team's logo is styled after the legendary bird Zapdos. </p> <h3 id="Team_Mystic.C2.A0" class="gh-sectionHeader">Team Mystic&#160;</h3> <div class="center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span></div> <p>The leader of <b>Team Mystic</b>, <b>Blanche</b>, studies Pokemon evolution and claims they cannot lose with their utilization of calm analysis. </p><p>The Blue Team's logo is styled after the legendary bird Articuno. </p> <h2 id="Gyms" class="gh-sectionHeader">Gyms<br/></h2> <p>Gyms can be found at real world locations, just like with <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeStops" title="PokeStops">PokeStops</a>. Once you've chosen your Team, you will then be able to interact with Pokemon Gyms when close by, and either battle or train and help defend the Gym. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p><br/> </p><p>Gyms can be claimed by one team at a time. They feature one gym leader and can have multiple trainers and their Pokemon at the Gym. How many can be there is determined by the Gym's&#160;<b>Prestige&#160;</b>level.&#160; </p><p><b>Prestige</b>&#160;is the most important indicator of a Gym's success. You can take over an opposing team's Gym by completely depleting the Gym's Prestige points. Alternatively, you can strengthen friendly Gyms' Prestige by training.&#160; </p><p>Below is a guide to the Prestige level. The Minimum Prestige points indicates how many points the Gym needs to have to reach that level. </p> <table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" style="width: 468px">  <tr> <td> <b>Gym Level</b> </td> <td> <b>Pokemon</b> </td> <td> <b>Minimum Prestige Points</b> </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level 2 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 2,000 </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level&#160;3 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 4,000 </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level 4 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 8,000 </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level 5 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 12,000 </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level 6 </td> <td> 6 </td> <td> 16,000 </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level 7 </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 20,000 </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level 8 </td> <td> 8 </td> <td> 30,00 </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level 9 </td> <td> 9 </td> <td> 40,000 </td></tr> <tr> <td> Level 10 </td> <td> 10 </td> <td> 50,000 </td></tr></table> <p>Know that if someone is currently training or battling at a gym, you won't be able to station your Pokemon there. Wait for the battle to finish and you'll be able to interact with the Gym again!&#160; </p> <div class="gh-blue-box">Note that defending a Gym gives you a <b>Defender Bonus</b>. Every 20 hours, you can collect this bonus from the shop, which awards you with 10 PokeCoins and 500 Stardust for every Pokemon you have stationed at a Gym.&#160;<br/><br/>A shield icon will appear on the top right of the shop screen if you have an active Defender Bonus. Tap the icon to collect the bonus once it's time! Each defending Pokemon earns you 10 PokeCoins every 20 hours, and you can have up to 10 Pokemon defending Gyms at a time</div> <p>Suggested Pages:&#160; </p> <ul><li></li> <li></li></ul>  <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716181210 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.060 seconds Real time usage: 0.090 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 30/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 48/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:20-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20160716181210 and revision id 864  -->
