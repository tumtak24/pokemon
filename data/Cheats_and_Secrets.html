Once you see Pikachu, <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Catch_Pokemon" title="How to Catch Pokemon">zoom and catch him</a> and he'll be yours forever! </p> <h2 id="How_to_Track_Rare_Pokemon_on_Your_Map" class="gh-sectionHeader">How to Track Rare Pokemon on Your Map<br/></h2>  <p>You can successfully track specific Pokemon if you keep your eye on the Nearby Pokemon list, located in the lower corner of your <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Map" title="Map">Map</a>. As you can see in the video above, if the Pokemon icon is moving up the list to the top left spot, that means you're getting closer to it! Try going in different directions until it gets less foot prints and moves up the list. You may find yourself right next to that elusive Scyther soon!&#160;<br/><br/>Also keep in mind that Pokemon will generally spawn in the same exact spot for everyone! So if you see a crowd of Trainers intensely staring at their Pokemon GO device, odds are they're catching a rare Pokemon.&#160; </p> <h2 id="XP_Trick_for_Lucky_Eggs_.28The_.27Pidgey_Exploit.27.29" class="gh-sectionHeader">XP Trick for Lucky Eggs (The 'Pidgey Exploit')<br/></h2>  <p>The <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lucky_Egg">Lucky Egg</a> doubles all XP earned for 30 minutes! Combine this with <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Incense" title="Incense">Incense</a> or a <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lure_Modules" title="Lure Modules">Lure Module</a> and you'll be raking in XP just by catching lots of Pokemon, as seen in the video above. </p><p>What you may not know is that , and Lucky Eggs actually double your normal 500 XP reward to 1000XP for each Pokemon you level up. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>To really reap in the benefits, you should capture a lot of common Pokemon, like <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pidgey">Pidgey</a> or <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Caterpie" title="Caterpie">Caterpie</a>, that require relatively few <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokemon_Candy" title="Pokemon Candy">Candy</a> to evolve. This has been referred to as the Pidgey Exploit, as Pidgey are very common for some people, and only cost 12 <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Candy">Candy</a> to evolve for 1000 XP. Even better: If you're evolving a Pokemon into one you haven't caught before, you'll get 2,000 XP! </p><p><b>The Step-by-Step Process to the "Pidgey Exploit":</b> </p> <ul><li><b>Step 1: Don't Transfer Pokemon</b></li></ul> <p>Collect easy-to-catch-and-evolve Pokemon, like Pidgey. Pidgey are easy to come by and only cost 12 Pidgey Candy to evolve. The more the better. Save them for a Lucky Egg evolution binge. Favorite all the Pokemon you want to evolve with a star to keep things in order. </p><p>If you have Pokemon that you know will evolve into something you haven't caught before, save them for your Lucky Egg XP spree, too. </p> <ul><li><b>Step 2: Plan for After Your Evolution Spree</b></li></ul> <p>You have 30 minutes to exploit the Lucky Egg, so only use it when you can also go out and catch Pokemon, using a lure or incense. </p> <ul><li><b>Step 3: Activate the Lucky Egg</b></li></ul> <p>You will now get double XP for every thing you do for 30 minutes. </p> <ul><li><b>Step 4: Get to Evolving!</b></li></ul> <ul><li><b>Step 5: Use your remaining time to catch Pokemon</b></li></ul> <p>As mentioned above, if you have any time left over after your evolving-spree, go out and attach a Lure Module to a PokeStop,&#160;activate an Incense, and get to catching. If you have the resources and are in a spot with multiple PokeStops next to each other, use a few Lure Modules to maximize the amount of Pokemon that appear! You can do this same thing pre-Lucky Egg as a way to stock up on Pokemon and Poke Balls, too. </p> <h2 id="Force_Eevee_Evolutions" class="gh-sectionHeader">Force Eevee Evolutions<br/></h2> <p>According to a user on , there appears to be a way to force Eevee to evolve into the form of your choosing. It also seems to be directly tied to the Pokemon cartoon show, in which three brothers had three different evolved Eevees: A Jolteon, Vaporeon, and Flareon. </p><p>Supposedly, if the the Eevee you choose to evolve is named after the one of the brothers, your Eevee will evolve into the designated form: </p> <ul><li>Rainer: Vaporeon</li> <li>Pyro: Flareon</li> <li>Sparky: Jolteon</li></ul> <div class="gh-blue-box"><b>Disclaimer</b>: This method still requires additional testing - Try this at your own risk!<br/></div>  <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716035249 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.044 seconds Real time usage: 0.077 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 44/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 84/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:103-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20160716035249 and revision id 997  -->
