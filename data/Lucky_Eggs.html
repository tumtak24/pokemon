Combine this with <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Incense" title="Incense">Incense</a> or a <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lure_Modules" title="Lure Modules">Lure Module</a> and you'll be raking in XP just by catching lots of Pokemon. Make sure you've stocked up on Poke Balls before doing this, either at PokeStops or the Shop!&#160; </p><p>Plan to evolve lots of Pokemon and explore new areas saturated with <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeStops" title="PokeStops">PokeStops</a> before activating a Lucky Egg to ensure you'll make the most of it! </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>This is also a great time to have one or two egg incubuators close to hatching, as you'll also get a burst of XP. </p><p>To really reap in the benefits, you could capture a lot of common Pokemon, like Pidgey or Zubat, that require relatively few <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokemon_Candy" title="Pokemon Candy">Candy</a> to <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_train_your_pokemon">evolve</a>. Evolving a Pokemon already nets you the most XP, so evolving Pokemon with a Lucky Egg grants you 1,000 XP a pop! New pokemon will also give a bonus, so combining lots of common pokemon to evolve with a couple high level new pokemon you've been waiting to evolve can make a great combo. </p><p><b>The Step-by-Step Process:</b> </p> <ul><li><b>Step 1:&#160;Hoard&#160;Pokemon</b></li></ul> <p>Collect easy-to-catch-and-evolve Pokemon, like Pidgey. Pidgey are easy to come by and only cost 12 Pidgey Candy to evolve. The more the better! </p> <ul><li><b>Step 2: Plan Accordingly</b></li></ul> <p>If you have Pokemon that you know will evolve into something you haven't caught before, save them for your Lucky Egg XP spree! Also, travel to an area with lots of PokeStops, like a popular park, if you think you'll have time left after evolving Pokemon. It'll take about 5 minutes to evolve 10 Pokemon. </p> <ul><li><b>Step 3: Activate the Lucky Egg</b></li></ul> <p>You will now get double XP for every thing you do for 30 minutes. </p> <ul><li><b>Step 4: Get to Evolving!</b></li></ul> <ul><li><b>Step 5: Use your remaining time to catch Pokemon</b><br/>This is why we traveled to an area with lots of PokeStops! If you have any time left over after your evolving-spree, attach a Lure Module to a PokeStop,&#160;activate an Incense, and get to catching. If you have the resources and are in a spot with multiple PokeStops next to each other, use a few Lure Modules to maximize the amount of Pokemon that appear! You can do this same thing pre-Lucky Egg as a way to stock up on Pokemon and Poke Balls, too.&#160;</li></ul> <p>With a Lucky Egg activated, each evolved Pokemon will grant you 1,000 XP! If you're evolving a Pokemon into one you haven't caught before, you'll get 2,000 XP! Catching a Pokemon will only net you 200 XP, but if you catch a new Pokemon, you'll get 1,200 XP. </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160716212417 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.036 seconds Real time usage: 0.072 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 7/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 12/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:111-0!*!0!!*!4!* and timestamp 20160716212417 and revision id 613  -->
