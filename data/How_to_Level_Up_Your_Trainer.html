The higher your Trainer level, the stronger and rarer the Pokemon you will encounter and the higher you can <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_train_your_pokemon">increase your Pokemon's CP</a>. Considering this, it's best to increase your Trainer level as efficiently as possible so you can compete with rival <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Teams_and_gyms">team's Gyms</a> and catch new, rarer Pokemon! To do this, you need to earn XP. </p><p>You gain XP for a variety of activities, including: </p> <table style="width: 300px" border="5" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">  <tr> <td> <b><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Catch_Pokemon" title="How to Catch Pokemon">Catching a Pokemon</a></b> </td> <td> 100 XP </td></tr> <tr> <td> <b><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Train_Your_Pokemon" title="How to Train Your Pokemon" class="mw-redirect">Evolving a Pokemon</a></b> </td> <td> 500 XP </td></tr> <tr> <td> <b><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Eggs_and_Hatching" title="Eggs and Hatching">Hatching a Pokemon</a></b> </td> <td> 100 XP per KM </td></tr> <tr> <td> <b><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeStops" title="PokeStops">Visiting a PokeStop</a></b> </td> <td> 50 XP </td></tr> <tr> <td> <b><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Teams_and_Gyms" title="Teams and Gyms">Training at a Friendly Gym</a></b> </td> <td> Varies </td></tr> <tr> <td> <b><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Become_a_Gym_Leader" title="How to Become a Gym Leader">Battling&#160;at a Rival Gym</a></b> </td> <td> Varies </td></tr></table> <p>Additionally, there are a few things that can earn you extra XP when <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Catch_Pokemon" title="How to Catch Pokemon">catching a Pokemon</a>, including:&#160; </p> <table style="width: 300px" border="5" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">  <tr> <td> <b><a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_Catch_Pokemon" title="How to Catch Pokemon">Catching a New Pokemon</a></b> </td> <td> 500 XP&#160;<br/> </td></tr> <tr> <td> <b>Excellent Throw</b> </td> <td> 100 XP </td></tr> <tr> <td> <b>Great Throw</b> </td> <td> 50 XP </td></tr> <tr> <td> <b>Nice Throw</b> </td> <td> 10 XP </td></tr> <tr> <td> <b>Curve Ball</b> </td> <td> 10 XP </td></tr></table> <p>To obtain a throw bonus, the thrown Poke Ball must land inside of the colored circle. The smaller the circle, the greater the bonus. So, for example, if you catch a new Pokemon with a perfectly thrown Poke Ball, you'll get 700 XP for it! &#160; </p> &#160;<span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>The 500 XP New Pokemon bonus also applies to <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Eggs_and_Hatching" title="Eggs and Hatching">hatching Eggs</a>, so if you hatch a new Pokemon, you'll get 1000 XP.&#160; </p> <div style="text-align: center" class="gh-blue-box"><b>Frustrated with Pokemon Go's bugs? &#160;</b></div> <h2 id="XP_Received_for_Gym_Battles" class="gh-sectionHeader">XP Received for Gym Battles<br/></h2> <p>Training at friendly Gyms and <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Gym_battles">challenging rival Gyms</a> earns you XP, but it varies. The closer your Pokemon's CP is to your opponent's and the more Pokemon you defeat, the more XP you will earn. </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p style="text-align: center"><b>Defeating rival pokemon and training against friendly pokemon</b></p> <p>If you want to maximize the XP you gain from battling, use a Pokemon with a CP score that matches, or is less than, the opponent's. Alternatively, find a friendly gym with some pokemon you can easily beat, and train repeatedly - or even insert one of your own lower level pokemon that another in your team can easily defeat. </p> <h2 id="Grind_for_XP_with_Lucky_Eggs_.28The_.27Pidgey_Exploit.27.29" class="gh-sectionHeader">Grind for XP with Lucky Eggs (The 'Pidgey Exploit')<br/></h2>  <p>The first item to consider when wanting to level is the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lucky_Egg">Lucky Egg</a>. When activated, this item will double all XP earned for 30 minutes! Combine this with <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Incense" title="Incense">Incense</a> or a <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Lure_Modules" title="Lure Modules">Lure Module</a> and you'll be raking in XP just by catching lots of Pokemon. Make sure you've stocked up on Poke Balls before doing this, either at PokeStops or the Shop!&#160; </p><p>Plan to evolve lots of Pokemon and explore new areas saturated with <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/PokeStops" title="PokeStops">PokeStops</a> before activating a Lucky Egg to ensure you'll make the most of it! </p> <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"></span></span> <p>This is also a great time to have one or two egg incubuators close to hatching, as you'll also get a burst of XP. </p><p>To really reap in the benefits, you could capture a lot of common Pokemon, like Pidgey or Caterpie, that require relatively few <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/Pokemon_Candy" title="Pokemon Candy">Candy</a> to <a href="/wikis/pokemon-go/How_to_train_your_pokemon">evolve</a>. Evolving a Pokemon already nets you the most XP, so evolving Pokemon with a Lucky Egg grants you 1,000 XP a pop! New pokemon will also give a bonus, so combining lots of common pokemon to evolve with a couple Pokemon that evolve into something new can make a great combo. </p><p><b>The Step-by-Step Process to the "Pidgey Exploit":</b> </p> <ul><li><b>Step 1: Don't Transfer Pokemon</b></li></ul> <p>Collect easy-to-catch-and-evolve Pokemon, like Pidgey. Pidgey are easy to come by and only cost 12 Pidgey Candy to evolve. The more the better. Save them for a Lucky Egg evolution binge. Favorite all the Pokemon you want to evolve with a star to keep things in order. </p><p>If you have Pokemon that you know will evolve into something you haven't caught before, save them for your Lucky Egg XP spree, too. </p> <ul><li><b>Step 2: Plan for After Your Evolution Spree</b></li></ul> <p>You have 30 minutes to exploit the Lucky Egg, so only use it when you can also go out and catch Pokemon, using a lure or incense. </p> <ul><li><b>Step 3: Activate the Lucky Egg</b></li></ul> <p>You will now get double XP for every thing you do for 30 minutes. </p> <ul><li><b>Step 4: Get to Evolving!</b></li></ul> <ul><li><b>Step 5: Use your remaining time to catch Pokemon</b></li></ul> <p>This is why we traveled to an area with lots of PokeStops! If you have any time left over after your evolving-spree, attach a Lure Module to a PokeStop,&#160;activate an Incense, and get to catching. If you have the resources and are in a spot with multiple PokeStops next to each other, use a few Lure Modules to maximize the amount of Pokemon that appear! You can do this same thing pre-Lucky Egg as a way to stock up on Pokemon and Poke Balls, too.&#160; </p><p>With a Lucky Egg activated, each evolved Pokemon will grant you 1,000 XP! If you're evolving a Pokemon into one you haven't caught before, you'll get 2,000 XP! Catching a Pokemon will only net you 200 XP, but if you catch a new Pokemon, you'll get 1,200 XP.&#160; </p><p>Happy leveling! </p> <!--  NewPP limit report Cached time: 20160715234805 Cache expiry: 86400 Dynamic content: false CPU time usage: 0.044 seconds Real time usage: 0.077 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 12/1000000 Preprocessor generated node count: 36/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 0/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 2/40 Expensive parser function count: 0/100 -->  <!--  Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00%    0.000      1 - -total -->  <!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_pokemon_go:pcache:idhash:102-0!*!0!!*!4!* and timestamp 20160715234805 and revision id 984  -->
